# HPSortingHatTest
Harry Potter Sorting Hat Personality Test

This project is a basic introduction to AngularJS functionality by creating a single page web-app for a simple multiple choice test.  Each response will have one or more of 4 variables, representing a Hogwarts house, weighted and counted towards a total.  The house with the highest total will be the result.  In the event of a first place tie between two or more houses, the user will be presented with a choice based on those in the tie.
